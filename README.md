# WebFluxExample 🚀

A minimal Spring WebFlux-based Transaction Service showcasing reactive programming principles with non-blocking I/O. Built for experimentation, learning, and modular backend design.

---

## 📦 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a basic **transaction service** using **Spring WebFlux**, ideal for developers exploring reactive stacks or preparing for production-grade reactive systems.

- **Reactive stack**: Spring Boot + WebFlux
- **Non-blocking data access**: Designed for scalability and performance
- **Modular structure**: Clean separation of concerns for easy extension

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Maven 3.8+
- IDE (IntelliJ, VS Code, etc.)

### Run Locally

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### Test the API

Once running, you can test endpoints using:

- Postman
- curl
- Swagger (if integrated)

---

## 📌 Features

- Reactive REST endpoints for transaction operations
- Modular service layer for easy extension
- Maven wrapper for consistent builds

## 🧪 Future Enhancements

- Add R2DBC integration for reactive database access
- Implement unit and integration tests
